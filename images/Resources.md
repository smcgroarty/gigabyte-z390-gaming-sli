#### Mojave Notes
The wireless card, BCM94360CS2, was natively supported. <br>
The RX 570 was natively supported, so no extra configuration. <br>
Most M.2 SSD/NVME drives are natively supported <br>
Was planning to disable any onboard LAN, because ewww wires. <br>
USB ports were the biggest dance I had. I managed to get them all working in some capacity, but it still was the single hardest part of the build. <br>
