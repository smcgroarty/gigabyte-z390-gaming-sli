### New hardware

There was some cost saving done, and I expected things to be not the easiest to overclock because of this, but lets review those really quick

##### I5 9600K
The i5 was chosen because of the $150 difference in price at the time.
The difference between the i7 8700K and i5 9600K was not worth the extra performance for the price either.

###### Gigabyte z390 Gamining SLI
Gigabyte boards have always had good hackintosh support, and this was chosen because of that. It also is an entry level z390 board, and I was not expecting to set any records with it.

###### Patriot Viper 4 DDR4-3000
This was another one that was chosen by budget. $100 for DD4-3000 vs $120 for DDR4-3200 and there is not a noticeable difference in speeds.
This was $100 for each 16GB. I originally bought 16GB then upgraded to 32GB with a second 16GB kit. the amount should meet my needs more than the speed.

###### MSI Radeon RX 570 Armor MK2
It was a sub $200 video card with 8GB on it. Most of the Radeon cards work well in hackintosh out of the box. At the time it was $45 more for the RX580, and I did not see a big difference in performance between the two.

###### Evo 860 m.2
This will be a bottleneck in the system later, but as for now it works good enough. I am not doing any 4K video editing, and I am not doing anything that requires a lot of storage on my primary drive.

###### Seagate Barracuda 7200
This is a 2TB storage drive. That is all, and I wanted something faster than a western digital 5400 drive. It was also one of the cheapest parts at $60 at the time.

###### Coresair H100I V2
Refurbished, off the shelf at the local computer parts store. It was under $100 and it lets me overclock the CPU and keep the temps under a reasonable amount.
Related Note:<br>
If I want to overclock more than 5.0GHz, I will need to get a bigger cooler or go drastic measures.

###### Thermaltake Smart 600
Have had one running for 3 years in my previously overclocked i5 computer without issue. It again is not a top rated part but it has shown to be reliable and it is 80+ certified.

###### Zalman Z9 Neo White Case
It was cheap, off the shelf case.
I added spare RGB to it for pretty colors.

###### Broadcom BCM94360CS2
I had the other broadcom card in my last hackintosh, it worked fine and mostly without, there was some airdrop stuff that would not work properly.
This one is a native Apple card from a Macbook Air, so why not give it a try.
With this and the adapter for PCI-E or to native motherboard, everything works out of the box, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will work on install.
These parts are not on the PC Part list because they were bought elsewhere, but the total was $60 for working wifi and bluetooth with near line speeds.

###### Monitors
* Samsung 28" UE590 UHD (x2) @4k

### Already Owned hardware
###### Hard drive
* OCZ Vertex 4 SATA SSD

This drive was in my old system, and used for about a year before I upgraded to a 500GB SSD. I thought it would work well for windows since it still has a bit of life left in it.

###### Keyboard
* Corsair K65 RGB

There was a release of the Corsair drivers for OS X and this allowed sleep to function 100% for me. It would not recover from sleep when using ckb-next

###### Mouse
* Standard simple Logitech G602 mouse
* Apple Magic Touchpad - First generation


###### A/V Stuff
* Logitech C920
* Blue Snowball Ice
* subwoofer and speakers

###### Insignia USB 3.0 SD Card reader
I got this after realizing I needed a card reader for the computer to go with the DSLR.
